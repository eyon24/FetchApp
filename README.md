Fetch Application

# Description

App that fetches data from https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json
and displays it. The data is sorted by listId then by name, and all items with
an empty name are removed. The data is fetched using RetroFit and displayed on a RecyclerView.
The app is scrollable so the user can access each item that is passed to the view.
